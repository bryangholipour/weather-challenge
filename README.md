# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

Although I ran out of time to polish/ complete this project, I'm happy I was able to do some initial work with API's. Pulling out the specific data you need from large objects with even larger arrays inside of them was very tricky for me, and I spent a lot of time stuck on that process. I was successful in getting the current weather forecast out and onto the page relatively easily, but the extended forecast proved much more difficult. Creating HTML elements within javascript code was another challenge for me, but my tutor was able to walk me through how that is done, and I'm glad I have that skill now. Another challenge for me with this assignment was figuring out I had to use lattitude and longitude coordinates to get weather results for a city. I think this might be a shortcoming of this API, and could have been spelled out more clearly in their documentation. I am turning this assignment in with only the temps of the 5 day forecast, but when I have more time, I will be able to put the other relevant forecast info such as humidity and windspeed into the forecast. I also unfortunately didn't have time to deal with the local storage, another thing I want to complete when I have time. I have included screenshots of the working app as well as the objects I was working with in the console.
